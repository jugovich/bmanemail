:mod:`event` --- event
======================

The event.py file is used to interface the BM_email program with the command line. For the ECT-584 all that needs to be 
done to demonstrate the program is to issue the run command from the command line. 

To call the run command from the cmd open a cmd prompt window and navigate to 

*install_path*/bmemail/src/

Then type:

>>> event.py run
